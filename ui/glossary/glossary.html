        In this antipattern [1], types have uses relationships to their subtypes. The presence of STK instances compromises separability of sub- and supertypes.
        In particular, it implies that there are circular dependencies between the namespaces containing sub- and supertype. Instability in the (generally less abstract)
        subtype will cause instability in the supertype, and the supertype cannot be used and understood without its subtype.

    <div id="cd_content">
        Dependency cycles between namespaces (CD) is a special instance of cycles between modules [1]. Often, only weak circular dependencies between two packages are considered:
        there must be one path connecting some class in a package A to some class in another package B, and another path connecting some class in B with some class in A.
        This antipattern is stronger: it requires that there is one path that connects a class in A with a class in B and then returns to A. For instance, it is not possible to
        break this antipattern by splitting packages. This antipattern is more difficult to remove as the path must be broken through refactoring.

        The presence of this antipattern implies that the participating packages cannot be deployed and maintained separately. In particular, if these namespaces were deployed in
        several runtime modules (jars), this would create a circular dependency between those jars.

        Betweenness centrality [1] is a measure of centrality for every type in a cyclic dependency.
        To efficiently break a cyclic dependency the most central path(s) have to be removed, therefore the most central types have to be refactored.
        <p/>
        In the visualization the betweenness centrality is visualized by the size of a disk.
        The bigger a disk is, the higher is its betweenness centrality.
        In the following figure class 4 has the highest betweenness centrality and should be refactored.

        The STK Rank indicates which classes of the STK antipattern should be refactored.
        It is visualized on a color scale ranging from green (low priority) to red (high priority).
        The supertype will always have the highest priority since it has to be refactored to get rid of the antipattern instance.
        In contrast, the subtype will always have the lowest priority.
    </div>
    <div id="level_content">
        The visibility level determines if all dependencies between classes are shown, or only important or very important dependencies.
        The importance of a dependency depends on the two classes it connects.
        The higher the betweenness centrality or STK Rank respectively of those classes, the more important is the dependency.
    </div>
    <div id="selection_content">
        By clicking on a class disk it gets selected, indicated by blue color.
        If the selected class is part of an antipattern its dependencies to other classes are shown.
        This is different from selecting an antipattern in the Antipattern Explorer since not all dependencies of the antipattern are shown.
        Selecting a class is useful for investigating a specific class in a complex antipattern.
       <p/>
        If a class is part of multiple antipattern, only the dependencies of the cyclic dependency are shown.
