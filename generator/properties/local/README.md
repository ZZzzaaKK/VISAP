You can use this folder for local properties that should be ignored by Git. Properties defined here will override other properties with the same name. For example, if the ``generator/properties/master/Setup.properties`` file specifies ``inputCSVFilePath=input/master/`` while your ``generator/properties/local/Setup.properties`` file specifies ``inputCSVFilePath=input/local/``, then inputCSVFilePath will be ``input/local/``. Other properties that are specified under ``inputCSVFilePath=input/master/``, but not under ``generator/properties/local/Setup.properties``, will still be taken from ``generator/properties/master/Setup.properties``.
