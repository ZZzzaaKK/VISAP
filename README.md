# VISAP
This project aims to be a revamp of https://github.com/softvis-research/Getaviz. In particular, it aims to reduce bloat in its source code while merging a lot of the features of Getaviz that were previously built separately through the efforts of many individual contributors.

## Current State
The project is currently in a pre-development phase. Porting of functionality from Getaviz is still ongoing, and while we have a rough idea of where we want to go, many important design decisions are yet to be made.

## Installation and Documentation
The development team actively uses and maintains https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVOGFnA-M=/ for project coordination and documentation. The Miro board also includes instructions for installation and usage. Access requests will generally be accepted. Most documentation is currently available in German only.

If you need help or have any suggestions, we appreciate your interest in the project, and hope you will file an issue or message the contributors directly.
